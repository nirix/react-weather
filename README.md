2. Create `src/config.json` with the example `src/config.json.example` file and enter the API key

## Decisions made

### City selector

A basic city selector was used as opposed to a larger searchable one for simplicity and speed, in a real world application I would implement a text based input that searches and suggests cities based on what people start typing in.
